# Endpoint Exercise

## Assigment

A common method of organizing files on a computer is to store them in hierarchical directories. For instance:

```
photos/
  birthdays/
    joe/
    mary/
  vacations/
  weddings/
```

In this challenge, you will implement commands that allow a user to create, move and delete directories.

A successful solution will take the following input:

```
CREATE fruits
CREATE vegetables
CREATE grains
CREATE fruits/apples
CREATE fruits/apples/fuji
LIST
CREATE grains/squash
MOVE grains/squash vegetables
CREATE foods
MOVE grains foods
MOVE fruits foods
MOVE vegetables foods
LIST
DELETE fruits/apples
DELETE foods/fruits/apples
LIST
```

and produce the following output

```
CREATE fruits
CREATE vegetables
CREATE grains
CREATE fruits/apples
CREATE fruits/apples/fuji
LIST
fruits
  apples
    fuji
grains
vegetables
CREATE grains/squash
MOVE grains/squash vegetables
CREATE foods
MOVE grains foods
MOVE fruits foods
MOVE vegetables foods
LIST
foods
  fruits
    apples
      fuji
  grains
  vegetables
    squash
DELETE fruits/apples
Cannot delete fruits/apples - fruits does not exist
DELETE foods/fruits/apples
LIST
foods
  fruits
  grains
  vegetables
    squash
